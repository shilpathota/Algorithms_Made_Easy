# Algorithms_Made_Easy
Algorithms are very important for programming and improves analytical ability. Explanation of Different algorithms made easy in this repository so that even a 10th grade student can understand and try.


In this repository, we have concentrated on approach to solve the algorithms and not the programming language.
1. Algorithm explained pictorically
2. examples of each algorithm
3. Applications of the algorithm - how it can be asked multiple ways
4. Complexity of algorithm
