# Counting Sort

The Counting Sort algorithm sorts an array by counting the number of times each value occurs.

### How it works

- Create a new array for counting how many there are of the different values.
- Go through the array that needs to be sorted.
- For each value, count it by increasing the counting array at the corresponding index.
- After counting the values, go through the counting array to create the sorted array.
- For each count in the counting array, create the correct number of elements, with values that correspond to the counting array index.
