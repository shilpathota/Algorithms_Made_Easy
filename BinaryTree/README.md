# Tree
A tree is frequently used data structure to simulate a hierarchial tree structure

Each node id the treee will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a defined acyclic graph which has N nodes and N-1 edges

# Binary Tree 

A Binary Tree Data Structure is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is commonly used in computer science for efficient storage and retrieval of data, with various operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Types of Binary Tree
#### Full Binary Tree
A full binary tree is a binary tree with either zero or two child nodes for each node.

## Traverse a tree
Given the root of a binary tree return the preorder traversal of its nodes values
